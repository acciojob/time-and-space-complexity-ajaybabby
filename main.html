		<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm 
		to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function
		of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on in efficient way.</p>
	<p>The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>Space Complexity</b> of the algorithm O(n).</p>
